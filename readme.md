## Configure

- Edit the config file `src/site.config.ts` for basic site meta data
- Update file `astro.config.ts` site property with your own domain.
- Replace & update files within the `/public` folder:
  - favicon.ico & other social icons
  - robots.txt - update the Sitemap url to your own domain
  - manifest.webmanifest
- Modify file `src/styles/global.css` with your own light and dark styles.
  - You can also modify the theme(s) for markdown code blocks generated by [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com). Astro Cactus has both a dark (dracula) and light (github-light) theme, which can be found in `src/site.config.ts`. You can find more theme(s) and options [here](https://expressive-code.com/guides/themes/#available-themes).
- Edit social links in `src/components/SocialList.astro` to add/replace your media profile. Icons can be found @ [icones.js.org](https://icones.js.org/), per [Astro Icon's instructions](https://www.astroicon.dev/guides/customization/#find-an-icon-set).
- Optional:
  - Fonts: This theme sets the body element to the font family `font-mono`, located in the global css file `src/styles/global.css`. You can change fonts by removing the variant `font-mono`, after which TailwindCSS will default to the `font-sans` [font family stack](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-family).

## Deploy

[Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) has a great section and breakdown of how to deploy your own Astro site on various platforms and their idiosyncrasies.

By default the site will be built (see [Commands](#commands) section above) to a `/dist` directory.
